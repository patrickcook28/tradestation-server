Welcome to PrecisionTrader Beta!

You're one of a select group of traders testing our platform before we 
launch publicly. Your feedback over the next 30 days will directly shape 
what we build next.

What You're Getting:
• 30 days of completely free access
• All features included

Important: You're Testing Software
PrecisionTrader is in beta. Bugs might exist. Start with paper trading 
if you're uncertain, or go live if you're comfortable—it's your decision 
and your risk. We recommend paper trading first to test the workflow.

Your Mission: 30 Days of Real Testing
• Place at least 5-10 trades using PrecisionTrader
• Use bracket orders, position sizing, and daily loss limits
• Complete 2-3 journal entries after trades close
• Try the liquidity overlay if you trade equities

Report Bugs & Feedback:
Email: support@precisiontrader.tech
Subject: "BUG: [what happened]" or "FEEDBACK: [your idea]"

Your Reward:
Complete our brief survey at the end of your 30-day trial and get 1 
free month when we launch.

Need Help?
• Sign up for TradeStation if you don't have an account
• Link your account on the Trade page

Most traders use the same platform everyone else uses. 
You're trying something new because you believe 
better execution matters.

Let's make something great.
